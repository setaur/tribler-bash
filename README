 TORRENT_ID is an index or infohash or a special keyword 'all', which will match all torrents. 
 Index is a first column of a 'list' command output. Infohash is a hash atributed by tribler 
 to a specific torrent. Can be viewed using command 'list-full' or i.e.:
 	 'tribler-bash show name,infohash all

PARAMETERS:
 -h, --help          Show this help
 -d, --debug         Enable debug, verbose mode
 -n, --no-headline   disables headline for 'list' and 'show' commands
 --api-key APIKEY    Provide Tribler API Key
 --api-port PORT     Provide Tribler API Port

CONNECTION:
 To connect to Tribler tribler-bash uses Tribler REST API. For this reason it needs to know
 Tribler API port and API Key. They can be provided via parameters '--api-key' '--api-port'.
 If they are not provided via parameters, tribler-bash will try to find tribler config 
 file in directory ~/.Tribler and read relevant values from it. This config file is in ini format,
 so to read it tribler-bash will ask and try to download tool bash_ini_parser from github 
 into script directory.
